Why migrate a shortcode plug-in to a block:
- Improve WYSIWYG experience for content editors and other non-technical users, as shortcode block doesn't render the content in the editor
- Add functionality and features not possible, or not easily done, with shortcode functions
- Can still retain the shortcode functonality, the shortcode and the block can co-exist in a single plugin
